# Bank Account Event Sourcing Demo

## The Task and the Problem
I wanted to understand not just what the current balance of a bank account was, but **how it got there**. Traditional approaches only store the final state—if the account shows `$500`, I don’t know how many deposits, withdrawals, or limit changes happened along the way. Without that history:
- Auditing is tough,
- Debugging is harder,
- Managing concurrency (when two operations hit the same account simultaneously) can get messy.

My task was to design a system where every change—creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing funds, setting a withdrawal limit—is recorded as an **event**. By replaying these events, I can:
- Rebuild the account’s history at any time,
- See exactly what led to the current balance,
- Handle concurrent operations without overwriting changes.

## Approach
### Event Sourcing
Instead of just storing `Balance = $500`, I store **every event** that produced that balance. If the account ended up at `$500`, I know precisely which deposits, withdrawals, and limit settings occurred.

### Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)
When saving events, I check the account’s expected version. If it doesn’t match the current version, I throw a **concurrency exception** rather than silently overwriting someone else’s changes.

### Clean Architecture
- **Core (Domain):** Defines entities, events, and rules, no infrastructure details.
- **Application:** Commands and queries rely solely on domain interfaces.
- **Infrastructure:** Includes in-memory event store, a read model (projection), and other implementations hidden behind interfaces.

This layering keeps the system flexible. As I learn more or requirements evolve, I can swap out the storage layer or projection mechanism without touching the domain logic.

## Projections (Read Model)
Replaying all events to answer a simple query (like *“What’s the balance now?”*) can be slow. After saving events, I update a **read model**, making queries nearly instantaneous. 

- Here, I used an **in-memory model**, but in a real project, I could use a database or another technology.
- The point is to separate fast reads from event-based writes.
